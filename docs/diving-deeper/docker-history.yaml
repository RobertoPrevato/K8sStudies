  content: >
    **Linux** was invented in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. He began developing the Linux kernel,
    the core of the operating system, while a student at the University of Helsinki. The
    first version, 0.02, was released that year, with version 1.0 following in 1994.

- title: Embrace, extend, and extinguish
  content: >
    "Embrace, extend, and extinguish" (EEE), also known as "embrace, extend, and
    exterminate", is a phrase that the **U.S. Department of Justice** found was used
    internally by Microsoft to describe its strategy for entering product categories
    involving widely used open standards, extending those standards with proprietary
    capabilities, and using the differences to strongly disadvantage its competitors.

- title: Steve Ballmer calls Linux a "cancer"
  content: >
    In 2001, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer famously described Linux as "a cancer
    that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches".
    Even worse, he said: "we have a problem {…} when the government funds open-source work.".
    These statements were part of Microsoft's broader anti-open source stance at the time.

- title: Solomon Hykes creates Docker
  content: >
    Solomon Hykes walked onto the stage at PyCon 2013 (Python conference) and revealed
    Docker to the world for the first time. Docker is one of the most influential
    technologies in the world of containerization. **Docker** enables developers to
    automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers.
    Docker revolutionized the way applications are built, shipped, and run, making it
    easier to create consistent environments across development, testing, and
    production. Docker uses two features of the Linux kernel: **cgroups** and
    **namespaces**. In its first version, Docker is only supported on Linux.

  content: >
    Satya Nadella becomes the CEO of Microsoft, since **February 4, 2014**,
    succeeding Steve Ballmer. Under his leadership, Microsoft begins to embrace open
    source technologies and cloud computing, marking a significant shift in the
    company's strategy.

- title: Microsoft falls in love with Linux 😏
  content: >
    Microsoft began to embrace open source more openly. Satya Nadella famously stated,
    "Microsoft loves Linux," signaling a major shift in the company's strategy.
    Probably somebody at Microsoft realized that a technology like Docker could not be
    left to the Linux community alone, and that Microsoft had to embrace it.

- title: Kubernetes is released
  content: >
    **Kubernetes** is released by Google as an open-source container orchestration
    platform, for **Docker** containers. It provides a powerful framework for automating
    the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes
    quickly becomes the de facto standard for container orchestration, widely adopted
    across the industry. Kubernetes was initially strongly coupled to Docker. At that
    time, Docker was the primary container runtime used by Kubernetes for managing
    containerized applications. Over time, Kubernetes evolved to support multiple
    container runtimes through the Container Runtime Interface (CRI), reducing its
    dependency on Docker.

- title: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
  content: >
    Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) was first announced at BUILD in 2016 and first
    shipped with the Windows 10 Anniversary update.

    WSL is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on
    Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019. It allows developers to run a Linux environment
    directly on Windows without the need for a virtual machine or dual-boot setup. WSL
    provides a Linux-compatible kernel interface and supports running Linux
    distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, and others directly on Windows. This enables
    developers to use Linux command-line tools, utilities, and applications alongside
    their Windows applications, making it easier to develop and test cross-platform
    applications.
