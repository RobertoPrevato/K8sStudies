This page describes my next exercise, of running a [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) database in a
local Kubernetes cluster managed with Kind.

For this exercise, I will follow the tutorial from _Digital Ocean_:
[How to Deploy Postgres to Kubernetes Cluster](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-postgres-to-kubernetes-cluster),
with some modifications.

_Work in progress..._ 🚧 🏗️
