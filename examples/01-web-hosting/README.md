# Web hosting exercise

This folder contains example files for my first exercise with Kubernetes. I wanted to
learn how to host multiple web applications running in the cluster and expose them to
the outside world. I also wanted to configure *HTTPS* using a self-signed certificate.

The exercise is documented here: [_Web Hosting_](https://robertoprevato.github.io/K8sStudies/kind/web-hosting/).
